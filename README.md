# Leadership Heroes — Clean Start

This repo is pre-configured to deploy with **GitHub Pages (Actions)**. No local build required.

## Deploy steps
1. Upload all these files to a **new repo** (e.g. `leadership-heroes-demo` — use lowercase).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source = GitHub Actions**.
3. Commit any change to `main` (the first push will trigger automatically).
4. Watch **Actions** build and deploy. Your site will be at:
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Local dev (optional)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
